# TODO: Fix KeyError in Multi-File Analysis Prompt

## Steps to Complete:

1. **Edit app.py**: Add escaping for curly braces in the code before inserting into the custom_prompt in the "Multi-File Analysis" section.
   - After reading and truncating the code, add `escaped_code = code.replace('{', '{{').replace('}', '}}')`.
   - Update the prompt f-string to use `{escaped_code}` instead of `{code}`.
   - This prevents LangChain from interpreting code's { } as template variables.
   - ✅ Completed: Added escaping and updated prompt.

2. **Test the Fix**: Run `streamlit run app.py` and test multi-file upload with a file containing curly braces (e.g., Python dicts). Verify no KeyError and analysis completes.
   - ✅ Completed: Multi-file analysis runs successfully without KeyError, processes files with curly braces (e.g., dicts/JSON), and generates detailed output including metrics and suggestions.

3. **Update TODO.md**: Mark steps as completed after verification.
   - ✅ Completed: Updated with test results.

4. **Complete Task**: Use attempt_completion once fixed and tested.
